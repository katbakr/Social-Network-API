  ## Description
   This project is a backend application that serves as an API for a social network. This application has multiple functions relating to the neccessary demands of a social media network. You can create, edit, and delete users. You can create, edit, and delete "thoughts" which function as user posts. And you can add and delete reactions and friends (user to user interactions). This application could easily be adapted to meet a wide range of social networking types. 


   **Warning, reaction and friend functionality is written but not yet functional**

  This project does require a few steps for installation: 
  * First step is to clone this repository into your local vscode through GitHub 
  * You will need to have Express.js, Node.js, MongoDb, Mongoose, Mongo Compass, and the external Insomnia app installed 
  * Next once you have the neccesary packaged installed using your terminal by running an "NPM i", simply type NPM start to start the server.

  ## Usage
This project has no front end usability, so all interaction has to be done using the Insomnia application to be able to visually see changes being made to the data through the controllers.
